<p>This is a database of rural infrastructure in North Queensland. It includes the location of structures 
    such as yards, wells and bores, and of homesteads and stock routes. Complementary information on 
    roads and land tenure is also contained in the database.</p>

<p>Rural infrastructure is an important cultural heritage that reflects the history of the cattle 
    industry and the evolution of the North Queensland landscape from the mid-nineteenth century 
    onwards.</p>
<p>As a material culture, largely consisting of wooden yard, fence and bore structures, sites are 
    disappearing from the landscape in bushfires; or, through abandonment as the ways in which the 
    cattle industry operates have changed over time. Where sites have survived their names may be
    forgotten. Other locations retain their name, even though the original site has disappeared.</p>

<p>Toponymy, the geography of placenames, is a valuable feature of outback landscapes for those 
    people who live in them, even though their locations may now no longer have any economic role.</p>
<p>Place names provide spatial referents for orientation in the landscape and in the mind. They
    can be used to describe personal, family and community histories, and for imparting knowledge 
    about the properties of former and present-day landscapes. There are vast outback landscapes 
    in North Queensland which appear to be ‘empty’ but which in fact are intensely humanised by 
    place names.</p>

<p>This database is compiled largely from 1:250 000 scale GIS datasets that are provided for public
    use by the Australian and Queensland governments <button type = 'button' onclick="location.href = 'https://thimblemill.com/nqland/stockRoutes.html'";><span>Data Sources</span></button>. 
    It is not exhaustive. Newly identified sites, as well as the (forgotten or newly acquired) names of 
    current ones, continue to be added to it.</p>

<p>So far, the database has been used to to record or update the name and location of cattle yards and 
   watering points in the lower Mitchell River valley, and to elicit information on past and present uses of 
   these sites from local people <button type = 'button' onclick="location.href = 'https://thimblemill.com/mitchell.html'";><span>Mitchell River </span></button>.</p>


<p>Currently, the database is being used to model seasonal stock movement in the Upper Gulf Country between 
   Kowanyama and Normanton and surrounding cattle stations. This model also  provides an  ‘aide memoire’ for 
   aged stock workers to use to describe the country they worked in and their  lifestyles there when they 
   were young men and women in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

   <p>The Edit, Query and Map Manager operations on this website are temporarily suspended. Instead, They are available 
 'desktop' form whereby the underlying database and related functions can be accessed locally on your own machine.</p>
